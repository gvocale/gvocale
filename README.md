## Hi there 👋 I'm Giovanni

I'm a Design Engineer who prototypes and builds real products.

- ⚙️ I design directly in code—working from real data, not idealized mockups—to prototype fast, iterate, and build production-ready UIs that actually hold up.
- 🛠 I design directly in code using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and CSS
- 🚀 I prefer web apps, internal tools, and power-user interfaces over marketing sites, though I can work from an existing brand thanks to a strong background in advertising.

- [giovanni.is](https://giovanni.is/) – My personal portfolio, always evolving
